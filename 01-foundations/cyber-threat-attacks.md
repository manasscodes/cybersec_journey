# Major Cybersecurity Threats & Attacks
Hackers use advanced techniques to find weaknesses in systems, steal or change data, and break into networks without permission. Below are the most common cybersecurity threats that target businesses, cloud storage, and personal devices:

## What is a Cyberattack?
A cyberattack is a conscious endeavor by people or gatherings to break or think twice about frameworks, organizations, or gadgets to disturb tasks, take information, or cause harm. These assaults can take different forms, including malware, phishing, ransomware, or forswearing administration (DoS) assaults. Cyberattacks target weaknesses in programming or equipment, expecting to take advantage of these shortcomings for malevolent purposes. They can prompt critical monetary misfortunes, information breaks, and functional disturbances. Safeguarding against cyberattacks includes carrying out vigorous safety efforts, customary updates, and client instruction to defend delicate data and keep up with framework trustworthiness.`

### Types of Cyberattacks

#### 1. Malware Attacks
Malware is a type of harmful software created to enter, attack, and compromise systems. It includes trojans, rootkits, and spyware.
Hackers use payload obfuscation, polymorphic techniques, and zero-day exploits to bypass intrusion detection systems (IDS) and endpoint protection platforms (EPP).

#### 2. Phishing & Spear Phishing Attacks
Phishing uses tricks and manipulation to steal login details, session tokens, and financial information. Spear phishing is a more targeted version that uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) to create personalized fake messages.
Hackers use domain spoofing, homograph attacks, and malicious macros to bypass security and trick users into revealing sensitive data.

#### 3. Ransomware Attacks
Ransomware locks important system files by encrypting them using asymmetric cryptography (like RSA, ECC) or hybrid encryption (AES-RSA). It then demands a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, to unlock the data.
More advanced types, like double extortion ransomware, first steal sensitive data before encrypting it. Hackers then threaten to leak the stolen data on dark web sites if the ransom isn't paid.

#### 4. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks
DDoS attacks overload a network by flooding it with massive amounts of traffic at different levels volumetric, protocol, or application-layer causing servers to crash and making services unavailable.
Hackers use botnets, amplification techniques to increase attack size, and HTTP flood requests to overwhelm websites. These methods help attackers bypass rate-limiting defenses and take down their targets.

#### 5. SQL Injection (SQLi) & NoSQL Injection
SQL injection attacks take advantage of weak web application queries by inserting malicious SQL code to modify database records, steal login credentials, or run admin-level commands.
NoSQL injection targets document-based databases like MongoDB and Firebase by altering query parameters, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

#### 6. Zero-Day Exploits & Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
Zero-day exploitstake advantage of unknown software vulnerabilities before developers release security patches, making them highly dangerous.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) use multi-stage attack techniques to stay hidden in a system for a long time. These include lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence mechanisms to maintain control over compromised networks.

#### 7. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks secretly intercept and modify data exchanged between two parties by exploiting weak encryption or unsecured communication channels.
Hackers use techniques like SSL stripping, rogue access points, and ARP poisoning to steal login credentials, hijack user sessions, or inject malicious code into data transmissions

#### 8. Insider Threats & Privilege Misuse
Insider threats occur whenCyber Security is important because the government, corporations, and medical organizations, collect military, financial, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on a computer and other properties like personal information, and this private information exposure could have negative consequences.
